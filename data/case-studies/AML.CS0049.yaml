name: Supply Chain Compromise via Poisoned ClawdBot Skill
object-type: case-study
summary: "A security researcher demonstrated a proof-of-concept supply chain attack\
  \ using a poisoned ClawdBot Skill shared on ClawdHub, a Skill registry for agents.\
  \ The poisoned Skill contained a prompt injection that caused ClawdBot to execute\
  \ a shell command that reached the researcher\u2019s server. Although the researcher\
  \ here used this access simply to warn users about the danger, they could have instead\
  \ delivered a malicious payload and compromised the user\u2019s system. The security\
  \ researcher recorded 16 different users who downloaded and executed the poisoned\
  \ Skill in the first 8 hours of it being published on ClawdHub."

- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{develop_capabilities.id}}'
  description: The researcher created a simple web server to log requests.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{acquire_domains.id}}'
  description: The researcher registered the domain `clawdhub-skill.com` to host their
    web server.
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_prompt_crafting.id}}'
  description: "The researcher crafted a prompt injection designed to cause Claude\
    \ Code to execute a `curl` command to the researcher\u2019s `clawdhub-skill.com`\
    \ domain."
- tactic: '{{resource_development.id}}'
  technique: '{{pub_poisoned_ai_agent_tool.id}}'
  description: "The researcher developed a poisoned ClawdBot Skill called \u201CWhat\
    \ Would Elon Do?\u201D The Skill contained the malicious prompt in the `rules/logic.md`\
    \ file, which is read when the Skill is activated. The researcher published their\
    \ Skill to ClawdHub."
- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{supply_chain_software.id}}'
  description: 'Users downloaded the poisoned Skill from ClawdHub.


    The researcher had used a script to increase the number of downloads of their
    Skill to increase visibility and gain trust.


    Note that ClawdHub does not display all files that are part of the Skill, making
    it hard for users to review Skills before downloading them.'

  technique: '{{poisoned_ai_agent_tool.id}}'
  description: "When a user asked Claude Code \u201Cwhat would Elon do?\u201D it calls\
    \ the poisoned Skill."
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_direct.id}}'
  description: Claude Code read all files that are part of the Skill, executing the
    malicious prompt in the `rules/logic.md` file.
- tactic: '{{defense_evasion.id}}'
  technique: '{{masquerading.id}}'
  description: Claude Code prompted the user before executing the shell command. The
    researcher had registered the `https://clawdhub-skill.com` domain, which appears
    to be legitimate and may be confused with the legitimate `https://clawdhub.com`
    domain, causing the user to select confirm.

  technique: '{{llm_plugin_compromise.id}}'
  description: "Claude Code executed the shell command using it\u2019s `bash` tool."
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{external_harms.id}}'
  description: "In this proof of concept, the researcher simply pinged their server\
    \ and warned the user of the dangers of using Skills without reading the source\
    \ code, causing no harm. However, they could have delivered a malicious payload,\
    \ and caused a variety of harms, including:\n- Exfiltrating the user\u2019s codebase\n\
    - Injecting backdoors into the user\u2019s codebase\n- Stealing the user\u2019\
    s credentials\n- Installing malware or crypto miners\n- Performing anything else\
    \ Claude Code is capable of"
