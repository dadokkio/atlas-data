name: OpenClaw 1-Click Remote Code Execution
object-type: case-study
summary: "A security researcher demonstrated a 1-click remote code execution (RCE)\
  \ vulnerability to the OpenClaw AI Agent via a malicious link containing a JavaScript\
  \ script that only takes milliseconds to execute. This vulnerability has been reported\
  \ and is being tracked to versions of OpenClaw as CVE-2026-25253. [<sup>\\[1\\]</sup>][1]\
  \  OpenClaw \u201Cis a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It answers\
  \ you on the chat apps you already use. Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives\
  \ on someone else\u2019s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose \u2013 laptop,\
  \ homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.\u201D [<sup>\\[2\\\
  ]</sup>][2]\n\nThe researcher demonstrated that when the victim clicks a malicious\
  \ link, a client-side JavaScript script is executed on the victim\u2019s browser\
  \ that can steal authentication tokens from the OpenClaw control interface via a\
  \ WebSocket connection. It then uses Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking to bypass localhost\
  \ restrictions to the OpenClaw Gateway API.  Once the connection was established,\
  \ it uses the stolen token to authenticate and modify the OpenClaw agent configuration\
  \ to disable user confirmation and escape the container, allowing shell commands\
  \ to be run directly on the host machine.\n\n[1]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25253\n\

  description: "The malicious script opened a background window to the victim\u2019\
    s OpenClaw control interface with the `gatewayUrl` set to a WebSocket address\
    \ on the researcher\u2019s server. OpenClaw\u2019s control interface trusts the\

- tactic: '{{defense_evasion.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_for_evasion.id}}'
  description: The malicious script performed Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)
    to bypass localhost network restrictions. It opened a new WebSocket connection
    to the OpenClaw Gateway server on localhost.

  technique: '{{agent_modify_config.id}}'
  description: "The malicious script disabled OpenClaw\u2019s security feature that\
    \ prompts users before running potentially dangerous commands. This was done by\

  description: "The malicious script disabled OpenClaw\u2019s sandboxing, forcing\
    \ the agent to run commands directly on the host machine instead of inside a docker\
    \ container. This was done by sending a `config.patch` request to OpenClaw\u2019\
    s Gateway API to set `tools.exec.host` to \"gateway\"."
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{cmd_script_interpreter.id}}'
  description: "The malicious script achieved remote code execution by sending a `node.invoke`\
    \ (OpenClaw\u2019s RPC mechanism) request to OpenClaw\u2019s API."
