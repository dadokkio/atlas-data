name: Exposed ClawdBot Control Interfaces Leads to Credential Access and Execution
object-type: case-study
summary: "A security researcher identified hundreds of exposed ClawdBot control interfaces\
  \ on the public internet. ClawdBot (now OpenClaw) \u201Cis a personal AI assistant\
  \ you run on your own devices. It answers you on the channels you already use \u2026\
  \ , plus extension channels. \u2026 It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android,\
  \ and can render a live Canvas you control.\u201D[<sup>\\[1\\]</sup>][1] The researcher\
  \ was able to access credentials to a variety of connected applications via ClawdBot\u2019\
  s configuration file. They were also able to invoke ClawdBot\u2019s skills by prompting\
  \ it via the chat interface, leading to root access in the container.\n\nThe researcher\
  \ searched Shodan[<sup>\\[2\\]</sup>][2] to identify Clawdbot instances exposed\
  \ on the public internet, some without authentication enabled. The researcher demonstrated\
  \ that the ClawdBot\u2019s authentication mechanism could be bypassed due to a proxy\
  \ misconfiguration.\n\nWith access to ClawdBot\u2019s control interface, they were\
  \ then able to access ClawdBot\u2019s configuration, which contained credentials\
  \ to a variety of other services. Across various exposed instances of ClawdBot,\
  \ they identified Anthropic API Keys, Telegram Bot Tokens, Slack Oauth Credentials,\
  \ and Signal Device Linking URIs. The researcher prompted ClawdBot directly via\
  \ the chat interface, which led to exposure of its system prompt. They were also\
  \ able to get ClawdBot to execute commands via it\u2019s `bash` skill, which at\
  \ least in once instance led to root access in the ClawdBot container.\n\nThe researcher\
  \ noted a broad range of other impacts they could have had with this level of access,\
  \ including:\n-\tManipulation of user chat history with the ClawdBot AI agent\n\
  -\tExfiltration of conversation histories of any connected messaging services\n\
  -\tImpersonation of users by sending messages on their behalf via connected messaging\
  \ services\n\n[1]: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\n[2]: https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Clawdbot+Control"

- tactic: '{{initial_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{exploit_public_app.id}}'
  description: "The researcher exploited a proxy misconfiguration present in ClawdBot\u2019\
    s control server to gain access to control interfaces that had authentication\

- tactic: '{{credential_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{agent_tool_config.id}}'
  description: "The researcher accessed credentials to a variety of services stored\
    \ in plaintext in ClawdBot\u2019s configuration file (`~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`,\
    \ which is visible in the ClawdBot dashboard. Across various exposed ClawdBot\

    \ Oauth Credentials\n- Signal Device Linking URIs"
- tactic: '{{execution.id}}'
  technique: '{{pi_indirect.id}}'
  description: The researcher was able to prompt ClawdBot directly through the control
    interface.
- tactic: '{{discovery.id}}'
  technique: '{{llm_sys_prompt.id}}'
  description: "The researcher prompted ClawdBot to `cat SOUL.md` (the file containing\
    \ ClawdBot\u2019s system prompt), and it replied with its contents."
- tactic: '{{credential_access.id}}'
  technique: '{{agent_tool_credentials.id}}'
  description: The researcher prompted ClawdBot with `env` and it responded by invoking
    its `bash` skill  and executing the `env` command, which contained additional
    secrets for other services.

  technique: '{{manip_llm_history.id}}'
  description: "The researcher could have used the found Anthropic API Keys to manipulate\

    \ messages."
- tactic: '{{exfiltration.id}}'
  technique: '{{exfiltrate_via_cyber.id}}'
  description: The researcher could have used the discovered application tokens to
    exfiltrate entire private conversation histories including shared files from any
    connected messaging apps (e.g. Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, WhatsApp, etc.).
- tactic: '{{impact.id}}'
  technique: '{{harm_user.id}}'
  description: "The researcher could have used the discovered application tokens to\
    \ cause further harms to the user, including impersonation by sending messages\
